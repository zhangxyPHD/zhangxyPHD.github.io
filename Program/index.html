    <div class="content">
        <strong>School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore</strong><br><br>
        A remarkable feature of smart biomaterials is their ability to deform in response to certain external bio-stimuli. 
        Here, a novel biochemo-electro-mechanical model is presented for theoretical characterization of urea-sensitive hydrogel in response 
        to external stimulus of urea, by the states of ionization and denaturation of the immobilized urease, where the model includes the effect 
        of the fixed charge groups and temperature coupled with pH on the activity of the urease. Here, a novel rate of reaction is proposed to 
        characterize the hydrolysis of urea that accounts for both the ionization and denaturation states of the urease subject to environmental conditions. 
        After examination with published experimental data, it is confirmed that the model can characterize well the responsive behavior of the urea-sensitive
         hydrogel subject to the urea stimulus, including the distribution patterns of the electrical potential and pH within the hydrogel. 
         The results point to the innovative means for generating electrical power via the enzyme-induced pH and electrical potential gradients, 
         when the hydrogel contacts with the urea-rich solution, such as human urine. <br> <br>

        The recent surge in the number of studies on seismic metamaterials is testimony to the fact that the concept of photonic crystals, 
        phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials is no longer limited to basic theories and dynamic characteristics.  
        Apart from the peculiar observation including negative stiffness, negative mass density negative refraction properties, etc., 
        auxetic metamaterials that govern negative Poisson’s ratio, nonreciprocal wave phenomena, origami/kirigami effects also find potential 
        applications in geophysics and earthquake engineering. Except man-made synthetic resonators/metastructures, recently forest trees at 
        geophysical scale are reported as naturally available seismic metamaterials with capability to mitigate ground born ambient vibrations 
        and incoming seismic waves at subwavelength frequency region. The work to be presented here elaborates a class of materials and structures 
        ranging from engineered phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials to natural seismic metamaterials that show exotic yet with outstanding 
        application potentials.  Besides discussing the peculiar yet wonderful wave propagation characteristics of periodic structures for wave active 
        control, topological protected interface modes, etc., the exciting wave dispersion response that found applications for manipulation Rayleigh wave 
        and possible forestation as a means for geographical regional isolation against ground surface wave motion will also be presented.<br> <br>

        The comprehension of the role of mechanical forces at the molecular level represents nowadays the focus of 
        incredible efforts in many different research fields of Biology, Biomechanics, Material Engineering, Biomedical
        Sciences. Fundamental phenomena such as DNA and RNA hairpins unfolding and refolding in enzymatic activity,
        sensing of metabolites, transcription termination and attenuation, morphogenic phenomena, cell motility, 
        focal adhesion and so on cannot be described without a comprehension of mechanical fields effect and
        macromolecular and cells force-response. Single-molecule stretching experiments opened up the possibility 
        of an impressive progress in in this direction. <br> <br>

        We describe in the framework of Statistical Mechanics the experimentally observed mechanical behavior of different
        protein macromolecules under cyclic stretching experiments. The proposed models reproduce quantitatively known 
        observed phenomena such as stretch induced domains unfolding and refolding, softening and variation of reference 
        configuration. Based on such microscale description, we then propose multiscale approaches to deduce the macroscopic
        material response depending on few constitutive parameters with a clear physical interpretation. <br> <br>

        To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed models we tested the macroscopic cyclic behavior of spider silks and 
        of a keratin proteins such as human, cow and rabbit hairs. By adopting experimental values of the macromolecular
        material parameters, we show that the model reproduces with surprising accuracy the obtained experimental behavior
        with a strongly non linear damage, dissipation and large permanent stretches. These results represent in our 
        opinion also a significant step forward in the perspective of the design of new bioinspired history dependent 
        materials.

      <div class="content">
      <strong>State Key Laboratory of Reliability and Intelligence of Electrical Equipment, School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, 300401, P. R. China</strong><br><br>
        The industrial robot is composed of mechanical structure, drive system, control system and perception system. 
        The analysis of industrial robots involves reliability modeling, reliability design, reliability evaluation and 
        reliability experiment, making the reliability analysis process more complex and difficult than the traditional 
        mechanical products. In order to ensure the high performance of reliability of the robots, the modeling, simulating,
        predicting as well as the testing of the robots should be systematically investigated. This talk will present our
        recent research works on reliability modeling and error prediction methods for industrial robots, including:
        kinematic reliability modeling and analysis, dynamics reliability modeling and analysis, error field modeling 
        and precision predicting. A computational framework of kinematic accuracy reliability analysis is proposed to 
        evaluate comprehensively the positional accuracy reliability for single coordinate, single point, multipoint 
        and trajectory accuracy for industrial robots. The computational accuracy and efficiency are significantly 
        improved compared to the traditional competitive approaches. In terms of dynamics reliability modeling and analysis, 
        a rotational sparse grid method for statistical moment evaluation and dynamics reliability analysis with enhanced 
        accuracy and efficiency is presented. Then, an error predicting method is proposed to evaluate the error values at
        any position in three-dimensional space stimulated by neural network technique. In this way, off-line precision 
        compensation for industrial robots can be easily realized. Finally, a series of reliability experiments and
        reliability analysis tools are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. <br> <br>
